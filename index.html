            Since the first reported cases of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in 1981,
            millions of more cases have been reported. HIV is a sexually transmitted disease that at one time was
            thought to just impact gay white men, but now the disease is more prevalent in developing countries. The
            management, reduction, and prevention of the virus is a public health issue that is being attacked from
            varying angles. Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among women living with HIV, and according to
            UNAIDS (2019), the likelihood of a woman developing invasive cervical cancer is up to five times higher as
            opposed to a woman who is not HIV infected. Both diseases are fully preventable, yet both are causing
            astronomical instances of mortality in women who reside in low-income, low-resourced, and developing
            countries.
         <p>In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV predominately affects adolescent girls and young women, nearly 68% of people
            living with HIV/AIDS are women, according to Ruger (2004). Nine out of ten women living with cervical cancer
            in low and middle-income countries succumb to the disease. According to Cancer.net (2020), cervical cancer is most
            often diagnosed between the ages of 35 to 44. Invasive cervical cancer can take 10-15 to develop after
            infection, therefore screening and preventative methods are integral to limit and eliminate the progression
            of cancer according to Melnikow (1998).</p>
         <p> There is a high dual burden of HIV and HPV infections in Sub-Saharan Africa, of which the mortality rates
            in HIV-positive women is are almost twice as high as HIV-negative women (Liu 2018). HIV-positive women with
            severe immunosuppression are 5 times more likely than HIV-negative women to have lower genital tract neoplasia’s,
            according to Ferenczy (2003).Virtually all cases of cervical cancer are caused from by a human
            papillomavirus (HPV) infection, of which
            there are about 15 types. HPV 16 and 18 are considered the “most dangerous” and “oncogenic” according to
            (Tiruneh 2017). HIV presents itself in two forms, HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is more common and is present around the
            world, on the other hand it is extremely rare to find HIV-2 in locations outside of West Africa. HIV-1 is more easily
            transmissible than its HIV-2, and it also develops into AIDS more quickly than HIV-2 according to (Types of
            HIV, n.d.).</p>
         Three effective screening methods that have decreased the rates of cervical cancer are Papanicolaou (Pap)
         smear testing, Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, and Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) testing. VIA tests
         are commonly used in more less resourced communities because Pap testing, although highly effective, are more
         difficult to complete due to it being a more enhanced cytology programs that many poorly resourced communities
         cannot afford (Tiruneh 2017). The benefits of using VIA are “low cost, simple administration, independence from
         laboratory services, and provision of real-time screening results, particularly in rural areas, where people
         travel for hours to visit a doctor” according to Tiruneh (2017). To reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality,
         antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment is used. The WHO recommends the use of ART in all HIV-infected
         individuals with cell counts of 500 cells/ul or less, the CD4 cell counts are used to indicate response to treatment (Ayele
         et al., 2019). The use of p16 immunohistochemistry expression in HIV-infected women is limited, but it has been
         able to differentiate mild cervical intraepithelial neoplasm (CIN1) from moderate to severe cervical intraepithelial
         neoplasm (CIN2/3) (McGrath et al. 2017). Preventative methods being implemented in more developed countries has
         decreased mortality rates from cervical cancer by more than 70%, and screening women every three to five has
         shown reductions in 80-90% in risks of lifetime risks according to Eddy (1990). </p>
